# ProofyX Investor Pitch Deck

**Build:** `python scripts/make_pitch_figures.py && python scripts/build_investor_deck.py`
**Output:** `ProofyX_Investor_Deck.pptx` (15 slides, 16:9) and `.pdf`

Every chart is regenerated from `scripts/make_pitch_figures.py`. If an investor
questions a number, the source is on slide 15 and the full research is in
`docs/PROOFYX_COMPLETE_ANALYSIS.md`.

## Structure

Follows the ten slides investors screen for, plus a Why-Now slide, a business
model slide, and a sources appendix.

| # | Slide | Investor question it answers |
|---|-------|------------------------------|
| 1 | Title / one-line intro | What does this company do? |
| 2 | Problem | Is this a real, acute pain? |
| 3 | Why now | Why does this get bought *this year*? |
| 4 | Solution | What is the unique value proposition? |
| 5 | Product | What have you actually built? |
| 6 | Validation | What evidence do you have? |
| 7 | Market | How big can this get? |
| 8 | TAM / SAM / SOM | What share are you underwriting? |
| 9 | Competition | Who else is doing this, and why do you win? |
| 10 | Business model | How do you make money? |
| 11 | Financial projections | What is the trajectory? |
| 12 | Team | Are you the right people? |
| 13 | The ask | What do you want, and what will it buy? |
| 14 | Contact | How do I reach you? |
| 15 | Sources (appendix) | Where did every number come from? |

Speaker notes with timings are on every slide.

## Before this deck leaves the room

1. **Slide 14 — replace both placeholders.** `REPLACE-WITH-REAL@EMAIL` and
   `REPLACE-WITH-REAL-NUMBER`. The previous version of this deck went out with
   Canva's `reallygreatsite.com` placeholders still in it; that alone ends a
   conversation with an investor.
2. **Slide 5 — swap the concept render for a real screenshot.** The product is
   running; use it. The caption currently says the image is a concept render, so
   the deck is honest as-is, but a real screenshot is far stronger.
3. **Slide 12 — confirm the roles.** Roles were inferred from commit history and
   file ownership. Correct them, and add LinkedIn URLs or prior credentials if
   any team member has them.
4. **Slide 13 — confirm the raise range.** `$1.5M-$2.5M` and the 40/25/20/15
   split are a starting position, not a modelled number. Sanity-check against an
   actual 18-24 month burn plan before quoting it.
5. **Slide 11 — have the spreadsheet ready.** The chart is a projection. If an
   investor asks for the model, do not improvise; send the file.

## Metrics audit (verified against sources)

Every figure in the deck was checked against its cited source. Two did not
survive, and both were corrected.

| Claim | Verdict | Action |
|-------|---------|--------|
| $3B+ US deepfake fraud losses, Jan-Sep 2025 | **Failed.** The research doc cites a Security Magazine article whose own headline is "more than $200 million". Independent sources put US 2025 deepfake fraud at roughly $712M-$1.1B, never $3B. | Replaced with the FBI IC3 2025 report: **$893M across 22,364 AI-fraud complaints** - authoritative and checkable. |
| 0.1% human detection accuracy (iProov) | **Failed as used.** The 0.1% is the share of *people* who classified every item correctly, not per-item accuracy. The old chart put it on a shared accuracy axis against ProofyX's 82.5%, which compares two different units. | Chart rebuilt as the **confidence gap**: 60% believe they could spot a deepfake, 0.1% got every item right - both from the same study, so the comparison is valid. |
| 8M deepfake files by end-2025, up from 500K in 2023 | Verified. | Kept. |
| $280K average loss per incident | Verified, but attributed to an aggregator. | Re-attributed to the **IRONSCALES Fall 2025 Threat Report** (survey of 500 IT professionals), the study that produced it. |
| Market $170M (2025) to $5.6B (2034), 47.6% CAGR | Consistent with the cited Market.us research. | Kept. |
| CorefakeNet 82.5% acc / 90.9% ROC-AUC / F1 81.3 on 332 held-out samples | Matches the recorded evaluation run. | Kept, scoped to CorefakeNet on the validation slide. |
| 564 ms/image, 4.9x faster than the ensemble | Matches the benchmark run. Note `docs/PROOFYX_COMPLETE_ANALYSIS.md` claims "7x" in three places - that is the design target, not the measured result. | Deck uses the measured 4.9x. **Worth correcting the research doc.** |
| Wav2Vec2 97.9% | Upstream model card, not our measurement. | Labelled as such on the validation slide. |

Two things still worth doing:

1. **Commit an evaluation artifact.** The CorefakeNet numbers are real but there
   is no results file in the repo, so "reproducible" currently means "re-run the
   harness", not "open this JSON". Slide 15 is worded accordingly, but a
   committed results file would be stronger in diligence.
2. **Fix the 7x claim** in `docs/PROOFYX_COMPLETE_ANALYSIS.md` so the research
   file and the deck agree.

## Claims that are deliberately hedged

These are labelled on the slides. Do not "upgrade" them in a later edit:

- **82.5% accuracy** is CorefakeNet on 332 held-out samples. It is not the
  ensemble, and it is not a public-benchmark number.
- **95%+ ensemble accuracy** is a *target*, shown as "In progress" on slide 6.
  The fusion calibration bug is disclosed rather than hidden.
- **97.9% audio accuracy** is the upstream Wav2Vec2 model card, not our
  measurement. Slide 6 says so.
- **Zero paying customers** is stated on slide 6. Volunteering this is what makes
  the other rows credible in diligence.
- **Financial projections** are labelled projections on both the chart and the
  headline.

The previous deck claimed "industry-leading accuracy" with nothing behind it.
That claim is gone.

## Assets

`assets/` holds the brand elements lifted from the original Canva deck (logo and
prism render, both re-extracted with their alpha channels intact) and the five
generated figures. Regenerate figures with `make_pitch_figures.py`; do not edit
the PNGs by hand.

# CIIC incubation deck (₹8 lakh ask)

**Build:** `python scripts/make_ciic_figures.py && python scripts/build_ciic_deck.py`
**Output:** `ProofyX_CIIC_Deck.pptx` / `.pdf` — 13 presented slides + 2 appendix.
**Strategy behind it:** `CIIC_STRATEGY.md` (also published as a web page).

The builder is data-driven: slide 7's spot-check rows and slide 5's demo image
are read from `assets/sample_batch_indomain.json`, `assets/sample_batch_fast.json`
and `assets/real_gradcam_indomain.json`. Re-run the batch scripts (see
`CIIC_STRATEGY.md` §5B-ii) and rebuild; the deck updates itself. A Grad-CAM is
only shown as "real output" if the recorded verdict on that fake is correct.

## Before the CIIC meeting

1. **Demo only with in-domain portrait samples.** On 24 OpenFake images
   (illustrations, scenes) the live build scored 50% — chance. On portrait
   deepfakes it is what slide 7 says. Pick two known fakes from
   `data/samples/Hemg_deepfake_and_real_images/fake` or
   `JamieWithofs_Deepfake_and_real_images/fake`, verify them the morning of
   the meeting, and keep the 60-second recording as fallback.
2. **Say both latency numbers.** 564 ms is the model forward; the API path is
   ~5–6 s per image on a laptop CPU because of face detection and preprocessing.
3. **Slide 13 team roles** are inferred from repository ownership; confirm
   names, departments, years and who is full-time.
4. **Fix the public website** before sending the link (99.4%, < 2 s,
   court-admissible, custody chain).
5. **Run `scripts/eval_adversarial.py`** and commit the results if there is
   time — it turns an amber row on slide 7 teal.

## Claims corrected in this pass (both decks)

- Verdict labels are two-class (`AI-GENERATED` ≥ 0.60 / `AUTHENTIC`) plus a
  HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW confidence band. The earlier "four-tier verdict" was wrong
  and has been removed from both decks.
- The confusion matrix on slide 7 is **reconstructed** from the reported
  precision/recall/accuracy (TP 126, FN 40, FP 18, TN 148) and says so. Replace
  it with the committed eval output in month 1.
